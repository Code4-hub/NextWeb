# NextWeb - Web Agency Project

This project template provides a minimal setup to get a React application working with TypeScript in Vite, including Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules tailored for a production environment.

## Features

- **React**: Library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- **Vite**: Next-generation front-end tooling
