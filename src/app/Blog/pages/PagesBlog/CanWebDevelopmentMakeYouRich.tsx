            <p className="font-light">
              Web development offers flexibility through freelancing. Skilled
              developers can work on multiple projects simultaneously, set their
              own rates, and choose clients, potentially increasing their income

              Web developers have the unique advantage of creating their own

              monetizing these products through subscriptions, ads, or sales,
              developers can generate passive income and scale their earnings.
              Successful web developers often build and sell premium themes,
              plugins, and SaaS (Software as a Service) products, turning their
              technical skills into profitable ventures.
