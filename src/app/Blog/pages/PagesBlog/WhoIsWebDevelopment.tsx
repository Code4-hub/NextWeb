            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">What is Web Development?</h2>
            <p className="font-light">
              Web development involves creating and maintaining websites and web
              applications. It encompasses a range of tasks, from designing the
              user interface (UI) to writing code that ensures the website
              functions correctly. Web development is divided into three main
              areas: front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack
              development.
