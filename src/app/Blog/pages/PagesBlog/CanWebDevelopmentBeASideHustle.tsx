              Getting Started with Web Development as a Side Hustle
            </h2>
            <p className="font-light">
              Starting a web development side hustle requires a blend of
              technical skills and business acumen. Here are some steps to help
              you get started:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
              <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Learn the Basics:</strong> If you're new to web
                development, start by learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript. Online platforms like Codecademy, freeCodeCamp,
                and Coursera offer free and paid courses to get you up to speed.
              </li>
              <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Build a Portfolio:</strong> Create a portfolio of sample
                projects to showcase your skills to potential clients. This can
                include personal projects, volunteer work, or mock websites.
              </li>
              <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Find Clients:</strong> Platforms like Upwork,
                Freelancer, and Fiverr are great places to find freelance web
                development projects. Networking with local businesses and
                joining online communities can also help you find clients.
              </li>
              <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Set Your Rates:</strong> Research industry rates to set
                competitive pricing for your services. Start with lower rates to
                build your reputation, then gradually increase them as you gain
                experience and positive reviews.
              </li>
              <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Manage Your Time:</strong> Balancing a side hustle with
                a full-time job requires effective time management. Use tools
                like Trello, Asana, or a simple calendar to schedule your tasks
                and avoid burnout.
