              The Current State of Web Development
            </h2>
            <p className="font-light">
              Web development has been a cornerstone of the digital age,
              powering websites, applications, and online services that people
              use daily. The demand for web developers remains high, driven by
              the continuous growth of the internet and the need for businesses
              to establish an online presence. As of now, web development is far
              from obsolete.

              Emerging Technologies and Their Impact
            </h2>
            <p className="font-light">
              Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI),
              no-code platforms, and advancements in automation have begun to
              influence the web development landscape. These technologies can
              automate certain tasks and streamline the development process,
              raising questions about the future role of web developers.
            </p>
            <p className="font-light">
              No-code and low-code platforms, for instance, allow users to
              create websites and applications with minimal coding knowledge.
              While these platforms democratize development, they are not yet
              sophisticated enough to handle complex projects that require deep
              technical expertise.
