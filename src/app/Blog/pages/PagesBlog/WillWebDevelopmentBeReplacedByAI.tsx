            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
              <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Lack of Creativity:</strong> While AI can generate code
                and provide design suggestions, it lacks the creativity and
                innovation that human developers bring to the table.
              </li>
              <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Complex Problem-Solving:</strong> Web development often
                involves solving complex problems that require critical thinking
                and a deep understanding of the project's goals and constraints,
                which AI cannot fully replicate.
              </li>
              <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Customization:</strong> Many web development projects
                require highly customized solutions tailored to specific
                business needs, which AI tools are not yet capable of providing.
              </li>

              The creativity, problem-solving abilities, and customization that
              human developers bring to web development are irreplaceable. The
              future of web development lies in a collaborative relationship
              between AI and human developers, where AI handles routine tasks
              and human developers focus on innovation and delivering
              exceptional user experiences. By embracing AI as a tool rather
              than a replacement, developers can create more efficient,
              creative, and dynamic web development practices.
