            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">What is UI Design?</h2>
            <p className="font-light">
              <strong>Overview:</strong> UI (User Interface) design focuses on
              the visual aspects of a digital product. It involves creating the
              layout, color schemes, typography, and interactive elements that
              users interact with.
            </p>
            <p className="font-light">
              <strong>Responsibilities:</strong> UI designers work on designing
              the look and feel of a product. They create visual elements such
              as buttons, icons, and menus, ensuring consistency and visual
              appeal across the product.
            </p>
            <p className="font-light">
              <strong>Skills Required:</strong> UI designers need strong graphic
              design skills, knowledge of design principles, and proficiency in
              design tools like Adobe XD, Sketch, or Figma.

              <strong>Overview:</strong> UX (User Experience) design focuses on
              the overall feel of the user experience. It involves understanding
              user needs and behaviors to create products that provide
              meaningful and relevant experiences.
            </p>
            <p className="font-light">
              <strong>Responsibilities:</strong> UX designers conduct user
              research, create personas, design user flows, and build wireframes
              and prototypes. They focus on making the product intuitive,
              efficient, and enjoyable for users.
            </p>
            <p className="font-light">
              <strong>Skills Required:</strong> UX designers need strong

              The Overlap Between UI and UX Design
            </h2>
            <p className="font-light">
              While UI and UX design are distinct disciplines, they often
              overlap and work together to create a cohesive product. Both roles
              aim to improve the user's interaction with the product, with UI
              focusing on aesthetics and UX focusing on functionality and
              usability.
            </p>
            <p className="font-light">
              Collaboration between UI and UX designers is crucial for creating
              products that are not only visually appealing but also
              user-friendly.

              </li>
              <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Wireframing:</strong> Creating low-fidelity sketches or
